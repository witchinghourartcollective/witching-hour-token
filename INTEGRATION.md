## App notes

- There is no liquidity yet.
- `tradingEnabled` is currently `false`.
- The deployer wallet currently holds the full supply.
- The owner still controls trading activation, fees, fee exemptions, and witching hours.
- Do not present this token as live-trading until liquidity exists and `enableTrading()` has been called.

## Suggested UI behavior

- Show a clear "not live" state while `tradingEnabled` is `false`.
- Hide or disable swap and market actions until liquidity exists.
- Surface `tradingEnabled`, fees, and witching window from chain reads.
- Keep admin actions separate from the public app UI.
